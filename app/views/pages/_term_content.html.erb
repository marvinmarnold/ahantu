Depending on the Third Party Accounts you choose and subject to the privacy settings that you have set in such Third Party Accounts, personally identifiable information that you post to your Third Party Accounts will be available on and through your Airbnb Account on the Site, Services and Application.  Please note that if a Third Party Account or associated service becomes unavailable or Airbnb’s access to such Third Party Account is terminated by the third party service provider, then SNS Content will no longer be available on and through the Site, Services and Application.  You have the ability to disable the connection between your Airbnb Account and your Third Party Accounts, at any time, by accessing the “Settings” section of the Site and Application.  PLEASE NOTE THAT YOUR RELATIONSHIP WITH THE THIRD PARTY SERVICE PROVIDERS ASSOCIATED WITH YOUR THIRD PARTY ACCOUNTS IS GOVERNED SOLELY BY YOUR AGREEMENT(S) WITH SUCH THIRD PARTY SERVICE PROVIDERS.

<p class="terms-p"><b>Accommodation Listings </b></p>

<p class="terms-p">As a Member, you may create Listings. To this end, you will be asked a variety of questions about the Accommodation to be listed, including, but not limited to, the location, capacity, size, features, availability of the Accommodation and pricing and related rules and financial terms.  In order to be featured in Listings via the Site, Application and Services, all Accommodations must have valid physical addresses.  Listings will be made publicly available via the Site, Application and Services. Other Members will be able to book your Accommodation via the Site, Application and Services based upon the information provided in your Listing.  You understand and agree that once a Guest requests a booking of your Accommodation, the price for such booking may not be altered.</p>

<p class="terms-p">You acknowledge and agree that you are  responsible for any and all Listings you post.  Accordingly, you represent and warrant that any Listing you post and the booking of, or Guest stay at, an Accommodation in a Listing you post (i) will not breach any agreements you have entered into with any third parties and (ii) will (a) be in compliance with all applicable laws, Tax requirements, and rules and regulations that may apply to any Accommodation included in a Listing you post, including, but not limited to, zoning laws and laws governing rentals of residential and other properties and (b) not conflict with the rights of third parties.  Please note that Airbnb assumes no responsibility for a Host’s compliance with any applicable laws, rules and regulations.  Airbnb reserves the right, at any time and without prior notice, to remove or disable access to any Listing for any reason, including Listings that Airbnb, in its sole discretion, considers to be objectionable for any reason, in violation of these Terms or otherwise harmful to the Site, Application or Services.</p>

<p class="terms-p">You understand and agree that Airbnb does not act as an insurer or as a contracting agent for you as a Host. If a Guest requests a booking of your Accommodation and stays at your Accommodation, any agreement you enter into with such Guest is between you and the Guest and Airbnb is not a party thereto. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Airbnb serves as the limited authorized agent of the Host for the purpose of accepting payments from Guests on behalf of the Host and is responsible for transmitting such payments to the Host.</p>

<p class="terms-p">When you create a Listing, you may also choose to include certain requirements which must be met by the Members who are eligible to request a booking of your Accommodation, including, but not limited to, requiring Members to have a profile picture or verified phone number, in order to book your Accommodation. Any Member wishing to book Accommodations included in Listings with such requirements must meet these requirements.  More information on how to set such requirements is available via the “Hosting” section of the Site, Application and Services.</p>

<p class="terms-p">If you are a Host, Airbnb makes certain tools available to you to help you to make informed decisions about which Members you choose to confirm for booking for your Accommodation.  You acknowledge and agree that, as a Host, you are responsible for your own acts and omissions and are also responsible for the acts and omissions of any individuals who reside at or are otherwise present at the Accommodation at your request or invitation, excluding the Guest (and the individuals the Guest invites to the Accommodation, if applicable.)</p>

<p class="terms-p">Airbnb recommends that Hosts obtain appropriate insurance for their Accommodations.  Please review any insurance policy that you may have for your Accommodation carefully, and in particular please make sure that you are familiar with and understand any exclusions to, and any deductibles that may apply for, such insurance policy, including, but not limited to, whether or not your insurance policy will cover the actions or inactions of Guests (and the individuals the Guest invites to the Accommodation, if applicable) while at your Accommodation.</p>
